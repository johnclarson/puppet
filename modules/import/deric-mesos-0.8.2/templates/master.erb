# A list of the available options can be seen by running `mesos-master --help`. Each
# option can be set in two ways:
#
#  * By creating a file in which the value resides (e.g. /etc/mesos-master/ip).
#  * By setting the environment variable MESOS_OPTION_NAME (the option name with a
#    MESOS_ prefix added to it).
#
# Configuration values are searched for first in the environment, thus values set
# in here precede those loaded from /etc/mesos-master (passed as command line arguments).

# ZooKeeper URL (used for leader election amongst masters)
<% if @zookeeper_url -%>
export MESOS_ZK="<%= @zookeeper_url %>"
<% end -%>

# Human readable name for the cluster, displayed in the webui
export MESOS_CLUSTER="<%= @cluster %>"

# IP address to listen on (in case that you start master
# on this node, it will bind to this address)
<% if @listen_address -%>
export MESOS_IP="<%= @listen_address %>"
<% else -%>
#export MESOS_IP=""
<% end -%>

# Port to listen on (default: 5050)
export MESOS_PORT=<%= @master_port %>

# master environment variables
<% @env_var.sort.each do |key,val| -%>
export <%= key %>="<%= val %>"
<% end if @env_var -%>
